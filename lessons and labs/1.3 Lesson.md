# Week 1.3 Lesson: Essential Linux Networking Commands

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Use 4 essential networking commands for security and troubleshooting
- Test network connectivity systematically
- Gather network information for automation scripts
- Diagnose basic network problems

---

## The Essential Four Commands

For network security and troubleshooting, you only need to master **4 key commands**:

**üîç `ping`** = Test if something is reachable  
**üìä `ss`** = See what connections are active  
**üó∫Ô∏è `ip`** = Get network information  
**üõ§Ô∏è `traceroute`** = Follow the network path

---

## Command 1: `ping` - The Network Heartbeat

### What Does `ping` Do?

`ping` sends a "hello" message to another device and waits for a "hello back." It's like calling someone to check if they're home.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Test if Google is reachable
ping google.com

# Send only 3 messages (not infinite)
ping -c 3 google.com

# Quick test (1 ping only)
ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
```

### Why You'll Use This

**In Security (Week 2):** Test if suspicious IPs are active  
**In Troubleshooting (Week 3):** Check where network problems start  
**In Python (All weeks):** Automate connectivity testing

### Real Example

```bash
# Test your network step by step
ping -c 1 127.0.0.1        # Test yourself (always works)
ping -c 1 192.168.1.1      # Test your router
ping -c 1 8.8.8.8          # Test internet
```

If step 2 fails ‚Üí router problem  
If step 3 fails ‚Üí internet problem

## Command 2: `ss` - See Network Connections

### What Does `ss` Do?

`ss` shows all the network connections your computer currently has. It's like checking who's currently talking to your computer.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# See all connections
ss

# See only listening services (most useful)
ss -tuln

# Breakdown: -t (TCP) -u (UDP) -l (listening) -n (numbers not names)
```

### Why You'll Use This

**In Security (Week 2):** Find open ports and suspicious connections  
**In Troubleshooting (Week 3):** See if services are running properly  
**In Python (All weeks):** Automate security scanning

### What the Output Means

```
State    Local Address:Port    Peer Address:Port
LISTEN   0.0.0.0:22           0.0.0.0:*
LISTEN   127.0.0.1:3000       0.0.0.0:*
```

- **Port 22 open to everyone** ‚Üí SSH server running (security relevant!)
- **Port 3000 only local** ‚Üí Development server (safer)

---

## Command 3: `ip` - Network Information Center

### What Does `ip` Do?

`ip` is your network information command. It tells you about your network interfaces, addresses, and routing.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# See your IP addresses
ip addr show

# See your network routes
ip route show

# See just your main IP (most common)
ip addr show | grep inet
```

### Why You'll Use This

**In Security (Week 2):** Identify your network configuration  
**In Troubleshooting (Week 3):** Check network settings  
**In Python (All weeks):** Get network info for scripts

### Key Information to Extract

```bash
ip addr show
# Look for: inet 192.168.1.100/24
# This tells you: Your IP and network range

ip route show
# Look for: default via 192.168.1.1
# This tells you: Your router's IP
```

---

## Command 4: `traceroute` - Follow the Network Path

### What Does `traceroute` Do?

`traceroute` shows the path your data takes to reach a destination. It's like getting turn-by-turn directions for your data.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# See path to Google
traceroute google.com

# Limit to first 5 hops (faster)
traceroute -m 5 google.com

# Alternative command (if traceroute unavailable)
tracepath google.com
```

### Why You'll Use This

**In Security (Week 2):** Understand network topology  
**In Troubleshooting (Week 3):** Find where connections break  
**In Python (All weeks):** Automate network path analysis

### Reading the Output

```
1  192.168.1.1      1.234 ms    # Your router
2  10.0.0.1         15.678 ms   # ISP equipment  
3  203.50.6.5       25.234 ms   # Internet backbone
```

Each line is a "hop" - one step closer to the destination.

## The Power Combo: Using Commands Together

### Systematic Network Diagnosis

```bash
# Step 1: Check your own network setup
ip addr show

# Step 2: Test local connectivity
ping -c 1 192.168.1.1

# Step 3: Check what's running locally
ss -tuln

# Step 4: Test internet path
traceroute -m 5 google.com
```

This 4-step process will solve 90% of network problems!

## Australian Context Examples

### Testing Melbourne University Connection

```bash
# Check path to Melbourne Uni
traceroute unimelb.edu.au

# Test if their web server responds
ping -c 3 unimelb.edu.au

# Check if you have any connections to edu.au sites
ss -tuln | grep :443
```

### Checking NBN Performance

```bash
# Test your ISP's responsiveness
ping -c 10 8.8.8.8

# See the path through NBN infrastructure
traceroute abc.net.au
```

## Commands You DON'T Need (Yet)

**Skip these for now:**
- `ifconfig` (older version of `ip`)
- `netstat` (older version of `ss`)
- `nslookup`/`dig` (DNS tools - not needed for security basics)
- `tcpdump`/`wireshark` (too advanced for beginners)
- Complex `iptables` commands (firewall management)

**Focus on the essential 4!**

## Quick Reference Card

| Command | Purpose | Example | Week You'll Use It |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| `ping -c 3 [host]` | Test connectivity | `ping -c 3 google.com` | All weeks |
| `ss -tuln` | Check open ports | `ss -tuln` | Week 2, 3 |
| `ip addr show` | Get my IP | `ip addr show` | All weeks |
| `traceroute [host]` | Find network path | `traceroute google.com` | Week 3 |

## Memory Tricks

**"PIST" (Ping, IP, SS, Traceroute)**
- **P**ing = **P**oke to see if alive
- **I**P = **I**nformation about me
- **S**S = **S**ee connections
- **T**raceroute = **T**race the path

## What's Coming Next

**Week 2:** You'll use these commands to find security problems  
**Week 3:** You'll use them to troubleshoot network issues  
**Throughout:** Your Python scripts will automate these commands

---

## Coming Up Next

In our **Lab session**, we'll practice these 4 essential commands until they become second nature.

In **Code Practice**, we'll build Python scripts that run these commands automatically and interpret the results!

## Key Terms to Remember

- **Connectivity Testing**: Using `ping` to check if devices respond
- **Port Scanning**: Using `ss` to see what services are listening
- **Network Configuration**: Using `ip` to understand your network setup
- **Path Analysis**: Using `traceroute` to see network routes
- **Network Diagnosis**: Systematic approach using all 4 commands together
