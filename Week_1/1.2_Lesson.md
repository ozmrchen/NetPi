## The Three Network Neighbourhoods

Think of networks like different sized communities where devices live and communicate:

**üè† WPAN** = Your bedroom (very small, personal)  
**üè´ LAN** = Your school (medium sized, local)  
**üåè WAN** = All of Australia (huge, wide area)

## WPAN: Wireless Personal Area Network

### What is a WPAN?

A **WPAN** is your personal bubble of connected devices - usually within 10 metres of you.

#### Real Examples You Use Every Day:
- **Bluetooth headphones** connecting to your phone
- **Apple Watch** syncing with your iPhone
- **Gaming controller** connecting to your PlayStation
- **Car Bluetooth** linking to your phone for music

### WPAN Characteristics

**Size:** Very small (0-10 metres)  
**Devices:** 2-8 devices typically  
**Purpose:** Personal convenience  
**Technology:** Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, NFC

#### Australian Context: Commuting in Melbourne
When you're on the tram to school:
- Phone connects to Bluetooth earbuds (WPAN)
- Myki card taps the reader via NFC (WPAN)
- Smartwatch shows notifications (WPAN)
- All happening in your personal space!

## LAN: Local Area Network

### What is a LAN?

A **LAN** connects devices in one location - like your school, home, or office. Everyone shares the same local network.

#### Real Examples:
- **School computer lab:** All computers connected to share printers and files
- **Home Wi-Fi:** Family devices sharing internet connection
- **Office network:** Employees accessing shared folders and printers
- **Internet caf√©:** Customers all on the same local network

### LAN Characteristics

**Size:** One building or campus  
**Devices:** 10-1000+ devices  
**Purpose:** Resource sharing, local communication  
**Technology:** Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi routers, switches

#### Your School's LAN

Right now, your school probably has:
- **Student computers** all connected via switches
- **Staff laptops** on the same Wi-Fi network
- **Shared printers** accessible from any classroom
- **Interactive whiteboards** connected to the network
- **Admin systems** for attendance and grades

**All of these form one big LAN!**

## WAN: Wide Area Network

### What is a WAN?

A **WAN** connects different locations across cities, states, or countries. It's how separate LANs talk to each other.

#### Real Examples:
- **The Internet:** The world's largest WAN
- **Bank networks:** Melbourne branch connecting to Sydney headquarters
- **University campuses:** Monash Clayton connecting to Monash Peninsula
- **Government networks:** State offices connecting to Canberra

### WAN Characteristics

**Size:** Cities, states, countries, worldwide  
**Devices:** Millions to billions  
**Purpose:** Long-distance communication  
**Technology:** Fibre optic cables, satellites, undersea cables

#### Australian WAN Examples

**NBN (National Broadband Network):**
- Connects every Australian town and city
- Massive WAN spanning the entire continent
- Your home LAN connects to this WAN for internet

**Corporate WANs:**
- **Woolworths:** Every store connected to head office
- **Commonwealth Bank:** All branches linked nationwide
- **ABC:** News from regional studios reaches Melbourne headquarters

## How Networks Work Together

### Real-World Scenario: Sending a Photo

Let's follow a photo from your phone to your friend in Perth:

#### Step 1: WPAN Territory
- Your phone connects to your Bluetooth keyboard (WPAN)
- You type a message to go with the photo

#### Step 2: LAN Territory  
- Phone connects to your home Wi-Fi (LAN)
- Data travels through your home router
- Router sends it to your ISP

#### Step 3: WAN Territory
- ISP routes data across Australia (WAN)
- Data travels through multiple cities via fibre cables
- Eventually reaches Perth's network infrastructure

#### Step 4: Back to LAN Territory
- Perth ISP delivers to your friend's home network (LAN)
- Their router sends it to their Wi-Fi device

#### Step 5: Back to WPAN Territory
- Their phone gets the notification
- Maybe it displays on their smartwatch (WPAN)

**Amazing fact:** This entire journey happens in under 100 milliseconds!

## Identifying Networks in Your Daily Life

### At Home
**WPAN:** Bluetooth devices, wireless mouse/keyboard  
**LAN:** Home Wi-Fi, ethernet connections  
**WAN:** Internet connection (when you leave your home network)

### At School
**WPAN:** Student phones connecting to earbuds  
**LAN:** School computers, Wi-Fi, shared printers  
**WAN:** School connecting to internet, other schools

### Around Melbourne
**WPAN:** Myki card, car bluetooth, fitness trackers  
**LAN:** Caf√© Wi-Fi, shopping centre networks  
**WAN:** Mobile phone towers, public Wi-Fi hotspots

## Network Size Comparison

| Network Type | Coverage | Typical Users | Australian Example |
|--------------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **WPAN** | 0-10 metres | 1 person | Your Bluetooth headphones |
| **LAN** | One building | 10-1000 people | Your school network |
| **WAN** | Cities/Countries | Millions | The entire NBN |

### Memory Trick: "Personal, Local, Wide"
- **P**WAN = **P**ersonal (just you)
- **L**AN = **L**ocal (your location)  
- **W**AN = **W**ide (wide area)

---

## Security Implications

### WPAN Security
- **Low risk:** Only your personal devices
- **Concern:** Bluetooth can be hacked if not secured
- **Protection:** Keep Bluetooth discoverable mode off

### LAN Security  
- **Medium risk:** Shared with others in same location
- **Concern:** Other users might access your files
- **Protection:** Proper passwords, firewall settings

### WAN Security
- **High risk:** Data travels through unknown networks
- **Concern:** Data can be intercepted anywhere along the path
- **Protection:** HTTPS, VPNs, encryption

## Australian Network Infrastructure

### Our Unique WAN Challenges
Australia's vast distances create interesting WAN challenges:

**Undersea Cables:**
- Southern Cross Cable connects us to New Zealand and USA
- Multiple cables under the Pacific Ocean
- If one breaks, internet can slow down nationally!

**Satellite Networks:**
- Remote areas rely on satellite WANs
- Higher latency but essential for outback communities
- NBN satellite serves farms and mining sites

**State Connections:**
- Fibre cables cross the Nullarbor Plain
- Backup routes through different states
- Ensures Australia stays connected if one link fails

## Common Misconceptions

**‚ùå "Wi-Fi is always a LAN"**  
‚úÖ Wi-Fi is just the connection method. It could be WPAN (Wi-Fi Direct between phones) or LAN (home Wi-Fi)

**‚ùå "The internet is one big LAN"**  
‚úÖ The internet is a WAN - it connects many different LANs together

**‚ùå "Bluetooth is the same as Wi-Fi"**  
‚úÖ Bluetooth is typically WPAN (personal devices), Wi-Fi can be LAN or WAN depending on what you're connecting to
