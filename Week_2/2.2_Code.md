# Week 2.2 Code Practice: Smart Vulnerability Analyzer ⭐

## ⚠️ CLASSROOM USE ONLY ⚠️

**Educational cybersecurity demonstration - use only in Raspberry Pi lab under teacher supervision.**

✅ **Permitted:** Learning these concepts in class  
❌ **Forbidden:** Using outside classroom or for malicious purposes  

Misuse of these techniques is illegal under Australian cybersecurity laws.

## Python Creates and Analyses Web Services
**Time:** 20 minutes | **Rule:** Maximum 5 lines per script!  
**Focus:** Python's unique power - create services, analyse them, assess risks intelligently

---

## Script 1: Simple Honeypot (5 minutes)

**📚 Educational Purpose:** Learn how security researchers create honeypots to detect malicious activity

Create `honeypot.py`:

```python
import http.server,socketserver
print("🍯 Starting honeypot on http://localhost:9999")
print("🍯 Open browser to localhost:9999 then watch the logs!")
with socketserver.TCPServer(("", 9999), http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler) as server:
    server.serve_forever()
```

**Run:** `python3 honeypot.py` (then visit http://localhost:9999 in browser)

**🔍 What This Teaches:** How security teams detect attackers by monitoring fake services

---

## Script 2: Phishing Awareness Demonstration (5 minutes)

**📚 Educational Purpose:** Understand how phishing attacks work so you can recognise and avoid them

**⚠️ REMINDER:** This creates an obviously fake demonstration using our own school website for educational purposes only.

Create `riskypot.py`:

```python
import http.server, socketserver, urllib.parse


class VulnerableHandler(http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        html = """<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Secure Login Portal</title></head>
<body><iframe src="https://hamiltoncollege.vic.edu.au/" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150px;left:50px;background:rgba(255,255,255,0.95);padding:20px;border:2px solid #0084ff;border-radius:8px;">
<h3>⚠️ FAKE DEMO - Account Verification Required</h3><form method="POST">Email:<input name="email" type="email" style="width:200px;margin:5px;" placeholder="fake@example.com"><br>Password:<input name="password" type="password" style="width:200px;margin:5px;" placeholder="demo123"><br><button style="background:#0084ff;color:white;padding:10px;">Verify Account</button></form>
<p style="color:red;font-size:12px;">This is a cybersecurity education demo - never enter real credentials!</p></div></body></html>"""
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header("Content-type", "text/html")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(html.encode())

    def do_POST(self):
        length = int(self.headers["Content-Length"])
        data = urllib.parse.parse_qs(self.rfile.read(length).decode())
        print(
            f"🎓 EDUCATION DEMO: This is how phishing captures {data.get('email', [''])[0]} / {data.get('password', [''])[0]}"
        )
        
        # Redirect after failed login
        redirect_html = """
        <html>
        <head><meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3;url=https://www.google.com"></head>
        <body><h2>🎓 Educational Demo Complete - This showed how phishing works!</h2>
        <p>In a real attack, your credentials would now be stolen. Always verify URLs before entering passwords!</p></body>
        </html>
        """
        
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header("Content-type", "text/html")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(redirect_html.encode())

with socketserver.TCPServer(("", 9999), VulnerableHandler) as server:
    server.serve_forever()
```

**Run:** `python3 riskypot.py` (then visit localhost:9999 and try typing fake credentials!)

**🔍 What This Teaches:** How to recognise phishing attempts and why URL verification is crucial

---

## Script 3: API Security Checker (5 minutes)

**📚 Educational Purpose:** Learn to assess API security and understand HTTPS vs HTTP differences

Create `pokemon_api.py`:

```python
import requests, json

pokemon_id = 25  # Pikachu
resp = requests.get(f"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{pokemon_id}")
data = resp.json()
print(f"🔍 API INTELLIGENCE: {data['name'].title()} (#{data['id']})")
print(
    f"⚡ Type: {data['types'][0]['type']['name']} | Weight: {data['weight'] / 10}kg | Abilities: {len(data['abilities'])}"
)
print(
    f"🔒 API Security: HTTPS ✅ | Rate Limit: {resp.headers.get('X-RateLimit-Remaining', 'Unknown')}"
)
```

**Run:** `python3 pokemon_api.py`

**Note:** Run `pip install requests` if you get import errors.

**🔍 What This Teaches:** How to evaluate API security and understand secure vs insecure protocols

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes & Ethical Reflection

### What You Learned

**🍯 Service Creation**: Python creates realistic honeypots and web services for security research  
**🌐 Web Analysis**: HTTP requests and response analysis for security assessment  
**🔗 API Security**: Testing API endpoints and protocol security (HTTP vs HTTPS)  
**⚡ Network Programming**: Socket programming and web service interaction  

### Why Python Beats CLI Here

**CLI tools (nmap):**
```
9999/tcp open  http
```

**Your Python analyser:**
```
🌐 Port 9999: 200 - Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 - Size: 1247 bytes
🔒 HTTPS PokéAPI: 200 - 2847 bytes
⚠️  HTTP Your honeypot: 200 - 1247 bytes
```

**The "Wow" Factor**: Python creates services, analyses security, and tests API protocols!

### Professional Cybersecurity Applications

**Legitimate uses of these techniques:**
- **Security researchers** use honeypots to study attack patterns
- **Penetration testers** create phishing demos to train employees
- **IT administrators** monitor APIs for security compliance
- **Cybersecurity students** learn attack vectors to build better defences

## 🛡️ Ethical Guidelines for Future Cybersecurity Work

### The White Hat Mindset

As you continue in cybersecurity, always remember:

1. **Get Permission First**: Never test on systems you don't own
2. **Responsible Disclosure**: If you find real vulnerabilities, report them properly
3. **Educational Intent**: Use skills to protect, not exploit
4. **Legal Compliance**: Follow all applicable laws and regulations

### Real-World Career Paths

These skills prepare you for legitimate cybersecurity roles:
- **Cybersecurity Analyst**: Monitoring for threats
- **Penetration Tester**: Finding vulnerabilities before attackers do
- **Security Researcher**: Developing new protection methods
- **Incident Response**: Investigating and containing security breaches

---

## Python vs CLI Comparison

**CLI Role**: Use nmap for discovery (`nmap localhost`), Python for intelligent analysis and interaction

**Python's Advantage**: Creates the vulnerabilities to analyze, not just discovers existing ones

---

## 🔍 Quick Reflection Questions

1. **What security information can Python extract that basic port scanning cannot?**
2. **Why is creating your own honeypot valuable for security learning?**
3. **What's the security difference between HTTP and HTTPS APIs?**
4. **How might a real attacker modify the phishing demo to be more convincing?**
5. **What signs would help you identify the fake login form as malicious?**
