## Firewalls: Your Network Security Guard

### What is a Firewall?

A **firewall** is like a security guard that checks everyone entering and leaving your network. It decides who gets in and who gets blocked.

**Simple analogy:** School security guard
- ✅ Lets students and teachers enter
- ❌ Stops random strangers
- ✅ Allows visitors with appointments
- ❌ Blocks suspicious people

### How Firewalls Work

Firewalls check every piece of network data and ask:
1. **Where is this coming from?** (Source)
2. **Where is it going?** (Destination)
3. **What type of data is it?** (Port/Protocol)
4. **Is this allowed?** (Rules)

### Firewall Rules (Simple Examples)

**ALLOW Rules:**
- Web browsing (ports 80, 443)
- Email sending (port 25)
- File sharing on local network

**BLOCK Rules:**
- Unknown incoming connections
- Suspicious file downloads
- Access to risky websites

## Common Network Threats

### 1. Unauthorised Access
**What:** Someone connecting to your network without permission
**Example:** Stranger using your home Wi-Fi
**Protection:** Strong passwords, firewalls

### 2. Malware
**What:** Malicious software that steals or damages data
**Example:** Virus that copies your files
**Protection:** Antivirus, firewalls, careful downloading

### 3. Data Interception
**What:** Someone "listening" to your network traffic
**Example:** Hacker at café stealing login details
**Protection:** HTTPS, VPNs, encryption

## Network Monitoring

### What is Network Monitoring?

**Network monitoring** watches your network for suspicious activity - like security cameras for your data.

### What Monitors Look For:

**Normal Activity:**
- Web browsing during work hours
- Email being sent and received
- Printing documents

**Suspicious Activity:**
- Login attempts with wrong passwords
- Large file uploads at 3 AM
- Connections to unknown servers

## Australian Examples

### Home Networks
Your home router has a built-in firewall that:
- Blocks unknown incoming connections
- Allows your devices to access the internet
- Monitors for suspicious activity

### School Networks
Your school uses firewalls to:
- Block social media during class time
- Allow educational websites
- Prevent malware downloads
- Monitor network usage

## Quick Security Check

**Which is more secure?**

1. **5 open ports or 2 open ports?** _______
2. **Password + SMS code or just password?** _______
3. **HTTPS website or HTTP website?** _______

## Key Takeaways

- **Firewalls** control what gets in and out of your network
- **Monitoring** watches for suspicious activity
- **Fewer open services** = better security
- **Multiple security layers** work better than one
