# ‚úÖ Why Raspberry Pi is Perfect for This:

## **Raspberry Pi Advantages:**
1. **Full Linux access** - Students have `sudo`, can install anything
2. **Real hardware** - Actual system to monitor (not virtual)
3. **All commands work** - `systemctl`, `journalctl`, `psutil` native to Linux
4. **DevOps authentic** - Most servers run Linux, this is real-world practice
5. **Portable learning** - Students can take Raspberry Pi home

## **Windows locked down is actually ideal:**
- Forces students to learn Linux (industry standard for servers)
- Raspberry Pi = their personal dev environment they control
- Codespaces = cloud Linux when at home
- Both environments identical (Debian-based Linux)

# üìù Updated 3.2_Code.md Focus:

## **Primary Environment: Raspberry Pi**
```python
# This runs ON your Raspberry Pi, monitoring itself!
import streamlit as st
import psutil

st.title("My Raspberry Pi System Monitor")
st.metric("CPU Usage", f"{psutil.cpu_percent()}%")
st.metric("CPU Temp", f"{psutil.sensors_temperatures()['cpu_thermal'][0].current}¬∞C")  # Raspberry Pi specific!
```

## **Perfect Connection to Lab:**
**Lab (Manual Ops):**
```bash
# What they did manually
htop                    # Watched CPU/memory
systemctl status ssh    # Checked service
journalctl -n 20        # Read logs
```

**Code Practice (Automated Dev):**
```python
# Now automate it with Python!
cpu = psutil.cpu_percent()           # Replaces htop
ssh_running = check_service('ssh')   # Replaces systemctl
recent_logs = get_logs(20)           # Replaces journalctl
```

## **Raspberry Pi Specific Features:**
```python
# Raspberry Pi has built-in temperature sensors!
import psutil

temps = psutil.sensors_temperatures()
cpu_temp = temps['cpu_thermal'][0].current
st.metric("CPU Temperature", f"{cpu_temp}¬∞C", delta=None)
```

This is **way cooler** than Windows monitoring because:
- Students see **real hardware temperature** 
- Can monitor their actual device
- Raspberry Pi-specific features (GPIO, camera, etc. if you want to extend later)

# üéØ Revised 3.2_Code.md Structure:

## **Script 1: Basic System Stats**
Monitor CPU, memory, disk on your Raspberry Pi

## **Script 2: Service Status Dashboard**  
Show status of SSH, networking (from lab Part 2)

## **Script 3: Temperature & Performance**
Raspberry Pi-specific: CPU temp + throttling detection

## **Script 4: Real-time Monitoring**
Live updating dashboard with `st.rerun()`

## **Challenge: Complete Ops Dashboard**
Combine everything: metrics + services + logs + network

# üí° The DevOps Story:

**Week 3.2 Lab (Ops):** "Learn what ops teams monitor on servers"
- Manual commands on Raspberry Pi
- Understand the data

**Week 3.2 Code (Dev):** "Build the dashboard ops teams use"
- Automate data collection with Python
- Display with Streamlit
- **Running on the same Raspberry Pi you just learned to monitor!**

**Result:** Students see the complete DevOps cycle on their own hardware!

**Should I write the 3.2_Code.md outline with Raspberry Pi focus?** 

I'll make sure to:
- ‚úÖ Raspberry Pi as primary (with temperature monitoring!)
- ‚úÖ Codespaces as secondary (same Linux, no temp sensor)
- ‚úÖ Connect directly to lab manual commands
- ‚úÖ Use `psutil` for everything (Linux-optimized)
- ‚úÖ Real DevOps workflow on real hardware
