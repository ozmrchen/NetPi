# Week 3.1 Lab: Manual Web Testing and Browser Tools

**Learning Focus:** Hands-on exploration of websites using manual tools and browser features

---

## Lab Setup

### Environment Check
**✅ In class:** Use your Raspberry Pi  
**✅ At home:** Use GitHub Codespaces

### Browser Requirement
**Use Google Chrome for this lab** - this ensures all instructions work the same for everyone.

### Pre-Lab Setup: Install curl

**On Raspberry Pi:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install curl
```

**On GitHub Codespaces:**
```bash
# Test curl is available:
which curl
curl --version
```

**Expected output:** You should see a file path and version information like `curl 7.68.0`

**Why curl matters:** This is a powerful command-line tool that lets us talk to websites without a browser, just like a robot would!

## Part 1: Browser Developer Tools Mastery

### Activity 1.1: Discovering Hidden Website Information

**Target Site:** https://httpbin.org/forms/post

#### Step 1: Basic Page Inspection
1. **Open Google Chrome**
2. **Go to:** https://httpbin.org/forms/post
3. **Right-click anywhere** on the page
4. **Click "Inspect"** (or press F12)
5. **Look at the Elements tab**

**Fill in what you find:**
- Page title: ________________________________
- Number of input fields you can see: ________
- Types of input fields *(e.g., text, email, password)*: ________________________________

#### Step 2: Form Element Investigation
1. **Right-click on the "Customer name" field**
2. **Click "Inspect"**
3. **Look at the highlighted HTML code**

**Complete this HTML:**
```html
<input name="________________" type="________________">
```

**Now inspect the Submit button:**
```html
<input type="________________" value="________________">
```

#### Step 3: Network Traffic Observation
1. **Click the "Network" tab** in Developer Tools
2. **Click "Clear"** to remove old requests  
3. **Fill out the form:**
   - Customer name: "Test User"
   - Customer email: "test@example.com"
4. **Click Submit**
5. **Look at the Network tab**

**You should see something like:**
```
Name: /post
Status: 200
Method: POST
```

**Record your results:**
- How many requests appeared? ________
- What was the main request method? ________
- What status code did you get? ________

### Activity 1.2: Security Headers Investigation

#### Step 1: GitHub Security Headers
1. **Open a new tab:** https://github.com
2. **Open Developer Tools (F12)**
3. **Click Network tab**
4. **Refresh the page (F5)**
5. **Click on the first request** (should be "github.com")
6. **Scroll down to "Response Headers"**

**Look for these security headers - tick if you see them:**

- [ ] `strict-transport-security: max-age=...`
- [ ] `x-frame-options: deny`
- [ ] `x-content-type-options: nosniff`
- [ ] `x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block`

**Count:** GitHub has ________ security headers

#### Step 2: Compare with Basic HTTP Site
1. **Open new tab:** http://example.com *(note: HTTP not HTTPS)*
2. **Repeat the header analysis**

**⚠️ Troubleshooting:** If Chrome automatically redirects to HTTPS, try opening an incognito window (Ctrl+Shift+N) and try http://example.com again.

**HTTP site security headers:**
- [ ] `strict-transport-security`
- [ ] `x-frame-options`
- [ ] `x-content-type-options`
- [ ] `x-xss-protection`

**Count:** example.com has ________ security headers

**Security comparison:**
- Which site had more security headers? ________________________________
- What does this difference tell you about website security? ________________________________

## Part 2: Command-Line Web Testing

### Activity 2.1: Basic curl Commands

**Open your terminal/command prompt**

#### Command 1: Get a webpage
```bash
curl https://httpbin.org/get
```

**Expected output:** You should see JSON data like:
```json
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.68.0"
  },
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/get"
}
```

**Your results:**
- Did the command work? ________
- How much text was returned? ________ *(e.g., "a few lines of JSON", "hundreds of lines")*

#### Command 2: Get just headers
```bash
curl -I https://httpbin.org/get
```

**Expected output:**
```
HTTP/2 200
server: nginx/1.10.0
content-type: application/json
```

**Your results:**
- Status code received: ________
- Server type: ________________________________

#### Command 3: Test HTTPS support
```bash
curl -I https://example.com
```

**Your results:**
- Does example.com support HTTPS? ________
- What status code indicates success? ________

### Activity 2.2: Form Testing

```bash
curl -X POST https://httpbin.org/post -d "name=TestUser&email=test@example.com"
```

**Expected output:** JSON showing your submitted data echoed back

**Your results:**
- Did the website process and echo back your data? ________
- What information was echoed back? ________________________________

### Activity 2.3: SSL Certificate Check

**This command checks SSL security:**
```bash
curl -vI https://github.com 2>&1 | grep -i 'ssl'
```

**Command breakdown:**
- `-v` = verbose (show details)
- `-I` = headers only
- `2>&1` = capture error messages too
- `|` = pipe to next command
- `grep -i 'ssl'` = search for "ssl" (case-insensitive)

**Expected output:** Lines containing SSL/TLS information

**Your results:**
- Did you see SSL/TLS information? ________
- Is the connection secure? ________

## Part 3: Manual Security Testing

### Activity 3.1: Form Security Assessment

**Target:** https://httpbin.org/forms/post

#### Step 1: Protocol Check
1. **Look at the address bar** - what do you see?
2. **Fill out the form** with test data
3. **Submit and observe** the results page

**Assessment:**
- Protocol used: ________________________________ (HTTP or HTTPS?)
- Is this secure for real login data? ________
- What did the website do with your submitted data? ________ *(Did it show it back to you?)*

#### Step 2: Input Validation Testing

**Test these inputs in the Customer name field:**

**Test 1:** Normal data
- Input: "John Smith"
- **Result:** ________________________________

**Test 2:** Very long data
- Input: Copy this 50 times: "A"
- **Result:** ________________________________

**Test 3:** Special characters
- Input: `<script>alert('test')</script>`
- **Result:** ________________________________

**Security Analysis:**

| Test | Accepted? | Security Implication |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| Normal data | _____ | Safe input |
| Long data | _____ | Could cause buffer overflow |
| Script tags | _____ | Could enable XSS attacks |

**Question:** What could happen if forms don't validate input properly?
*Hint: Could it break the website? Could someone steal information?*

2. **Any email addresses:** ________________________________
3. **Any phone numbers:** ________________________________
4. **Links to other sites:** ________________________________
5. **Contact or About page location:** ________________________________

#### Step 2: Error Page Testing
1. **Visit your chosen site + /this-page-does-not-exist**
   *(e.g., https://www.monash.edu/this-page-does-not-exist)*
2. **Observe the error page**

**Error analysis:**
- What status code did you get? ________ 
- Does the error page reveal server information? ________
- What should a secure error page look like? ________________________________

## Troubleshooting Guide

**❌ curl command not found:**
- Raspberry Pi: `sudo apt-get install curl`
- Codespaces: Should be pre-installed

**❌ Chrome redirects HTTP to HTTPS:**
- Open incognito window (Ctrl+Shift+N)
- Try the HTTP site again

**❌ Developer Tools look different:**
- Make sure you're using Google Chrome
- Press F12 or right-click → Inspect

**❌ Network tab shows too many requests:**
- Click "Clear" first
- Focus on the main POST request
- Ignore small image/CSS requests

**❌ curl output is confusing:**
- That's normal! Focus on finding the status code
- Look for "200" (success) or "404" (not found)

**❌ Can't find security headers:**
- Make sure you clicked on the main request (usually first one)
- Scroll down in the headers section
- Headers might have slightly different names

**❌ University website won't load:**
- Try a different university from the list
- Check your internet connection
- Use the backup option: https://example.com
