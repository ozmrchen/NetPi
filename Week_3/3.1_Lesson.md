## Activity 3: The Scale Problem Challenge

<img src="phone2500.png" width="300">

### The Impossible Task

**Scenario:** Your parents want you to check your phone 2,500 times tonight to make sure it's working properly. Each check means:

- Open every app
- Test every feature
- Take a screenshot
- Each check takes 2 minutes

### Your Challenge (Individual Work)

**Calculate:**

1. How many hours would this take? ________
2. How many days without sleep? ________
3. Is this humanly possible? ________

### Real Business Examples

Companies face this same impossible challenge:

- **Commonwealth Bank**: Tests 5,000+ web pages daily for security
- **Netflix**: Tests streaming on 2,000+ device combinations
- **myGov**: Verifies 50+ government services work for 8 million users
- **Your School Portal**: Tests login systems, grade access, timetables

**The Solution:**

- **Manual testing**: 1 person, 1 month of solid work
- **Automated testing**: 1 computer, 1 night while everyone sleeps

### Discussion Activity
