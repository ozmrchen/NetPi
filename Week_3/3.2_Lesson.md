   - Week 1: They learned network commands and gathered network data
   - Week 2: They learned security monitoring and threat detection
   - Week 3.1: They learned automation with Playwright
   - **Week 3.2**: Combine all of it into visual monitoring dashboards

3. **Curriculum alignment:**
   - **AC21 (KK2.1.14-15)**: Data visualizations for informing/persuading audiences
   - **AC22**: Network monitoring and threat evaluation
   - **U4SAC**: Security monitoring practices
