# ðŸ’» Week 3.3 Code: Writing CI/CD Automation (Dev)

## Script 1: Simple GitHub Action (5 min)
Create `.github/workflows/hello.yml`:
```yaml
name: Hello World
on: [push]
jobs:
  greet:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello from GitHub Actions!"
```

## Script 2: Automated Python Testing (5 min)
Create workflow that runs Python tests:
```yaml
name: Test Python Code
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      - run: python3 -m pytest tests/
```

## Script 3: Automated Playwright Tests (5 min)
Run your Week 3.1 Playwright tests automatically:
```yaml
name: Automated Web Tests
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: pip install playwright
      - run: playwright install
      - run: python3 auto_screenshot.py
```

## Script 4: Deploy Streamlit Dashboard (5 min)
Automatically deploy your monitoring dashboard when code changes:
```yaml
name: Deploy Dashboard
on: 
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: streamlit run dashboard.py
```

## Challenge: Complete CI/CD Pipeline
Combine everything:
- Run security scans (Week 2 tools)
- Execute Playwright tests (Week 3.1)
- Test monitoring dashboard (Week 3.2)
- Deploy if all pass
- Send notification on failure

# ðŸ“Š Assessment Preparation

Week 3.3 prepares students for Week 4 assessment by covering:

**Unit 2 AC21 (KK2.1.9):**
- Version control (GitHub)
- Project monitoring (GitHub Actions logs)
- Task delegation (automated workflows)

**Unit 4 SAC connections:**
- Software development practices
- Automated testing
- Version control systems
- Development environments

# ðŸŽ“ Key Takeaways

By end of Week 3.3, students understand:

âœ… **CI/CD automates the entire development workflow**
- Code â†’ Test â†’ Deploy â†’ Monitor (all automatic)

âœ… **GitHub Actions is a free CI/CD tool**
- Anyone can use it for their projects

âœ… **DevOps means automation everywhere**
- Ops: Automated monitoring and deployment
- Dev: Automated testing and builds

âœ… **Professional workflow preparation**
- Real companies use these exact tools
- Portfolio-ready skills

# Alternative: If GitHub Actions too complex

**Simpler 3.3 option:** Integration & Review Week
- Combine Playwright + Streamlit into one project
- Build automated monitoring that includes web testing
- Review all Week 1-3 concepts
- Practice problems for assessment
