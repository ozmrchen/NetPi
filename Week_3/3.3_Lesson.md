# Week 3.3 Outline: Automated Testing & Deployment (CI/CD Basics)

# ðŸŽ¯ Overview

**Theme:** Bringing it all together - Automated Testing & Continuous Integration/Deployment

**The DevOps Cycle Complete:**
- Week 3.1: Manual testing â†’ Automated testing (Playwright)
- Week 3.2: Manual monitoring â†’ Automated dashboards (Streamlit)  
- **Week 3.3: Manual deployment â†’ Automated CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**

# ðŸ“š Week 3.3 Lesson: Introduction to CI/CD

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what CI/CD means and why it matters
- Explain how automated testing prevents bugs in production
- Connect CI/CD to the DevOps workflow
- Recognise GitHub Actions as a CI/CD tool

## Key Concepts
**Continuous Integration (CI):**
- Automatically test code when developers make changes
- Catch bugs before they reach production
- Run Playwright tests automatically on every commit

**Continuous Deployment (CD):**
- Automatically deploy working code
- Update dashboards when code changes
- Deploy Streamlit apps automatically

## Real-World Examples
- Commonwealth Bank: Thousands of automated tests run before any code goes live
- Atlassian: Every code change triggers automated security scans
- Your School: Automated testing could catch bugs in student portal updates

## The Complete Workflow
```
Developer writes code 
â†’ Push to GitHub 
â†’ GitHub Actions runs automatically
â†’ Playwright tests execute
â†’ Security scans run
â†’ If all pass â†’ Deploy to production
â†’ Monitoring dashboard shows health
```
